## Rusty Roguelike

A dungeon-crawler with procedurally generated levels, enemies of increasing difficulty, and turn-based movement.

The land is beset by evil pouring forth from the dungeon. Our protagonist seeks the powerful Amulet of Yara to stem the tide.

## Game Loop

1. Enter dungeon level
2. Explore, reveal the map
3. Encounter enemies to fight or flee from
4. Find power-ups
5. Locate the level exit - repeat

## MVP

2. Place the player character and allow it to move
3. Spawn enemies, draw them, and allow the player to attack them by moving into them
4. Add a health system and a combat system that uses it
5. Add healing potions
6. Dispaly a "game over" screen when the player dies
7. Add the Amulet of Yara to the level and let the player win by reaching it

2. Add more interesting dungeon designs
3. Add some dungeon themes
4. Add multiple dungeon layers, with the amulet on the last one
5. Add varied weapons to the game
6. Move to a data-driven design for spawning enemies
